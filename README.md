# Volzbrew Website Repo

Volzbrew is a ReactJS and MaterialUI based, mobile-ready, website and blog.


# New Features!

  - General Setup 
  - Development Section(in progress) 
  - Compile Section
  - Push to Git Section 
  
### Tech

Volzbrew uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - Javascript UI by Facebook!
* [MaterialUI] - UI elements by Google!
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend


### Installation

Volzbrew requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.10+ to run.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd volzbrewreact
$ npm install
```


### Development
<<<<<<< HEAD
To begin the development, run 'npm start' or 'yarn start'.
When you save a file, code will auto-compile, or show error?, and re-launch development.
=======

Compile the code and start the local server.

```sh
$ npm start
```

#### Important Files and Folders

* package.json - describes dependencies installed with 'npm install'
* build/ - contains production files for website, generated with 'npm run build'
* src/ - contains development files for website
* src/App.js - app starting point, router setup, and page declarations
* src/imgs - website images
* src/components - generic react components that occur the same on multiple pages; i.e. Navbar, Footer
* src/pages/ - website pages
* src/index.css - class styling and media queries
* src/style/theme.js - MaterialUI generic theme styling

#### Making a New Page

1. Copy and rename a folder of a page that is similiar to what you are going to make.
2. Add your page to the site in App.js
  a. Add an 'import YourPage from './pages/Your'' - notice how the names are not the same
  b. Declare your page with 'const Your = () => (<div> <YourPage /> </div>)'
  c. Add your page to the router with a path("URL") of your choosing '<Route path='/yourPage' component={YourPage} />'
  d. Check the console for compiling issues to see if you missed anything(see common problems below)
  e. Navigate to localhost/YourPage to see your new page
3. Create a link to your page using a button '<Link to="/yourPage"><Button>ButtonText</Button></Link>'

#### Import MaterialUI Components

1. Grab code for the DOM elements from the MaterialUI /demo page
2. Take note of the specific element styling described in 'const styles' on the /demo page
3. Change references to 'className={styles.root}' to 'style={styles.elementName}'
4. Verify import statements for MaterialUI dependencies

### Compiling

Compile code for production, see console output after running.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Pushing updates to Git

Push early and often! Don't let your code rot and have to deal with merge conflicts.

Stage changes
```sh
$ git add . 
```

Add a commit message
```sh
$ git commit -m "succinct message about your update" 
```

Push to github
```sh
$ git push origin master 
```

Notes:
We aren't using branches.
The '.gitignore' file describes files and folders which changes will not be recorded or synced with git.
